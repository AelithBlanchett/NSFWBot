#TODO

##Important
-   Separate the Fighter entity from the 'augmented' one used in fights with hp, lp and stuff
-   Re-arrange CommandHandler / Fight logic
-   Factorise everything
-   Refactor the fight class, use functions instead of just changing variables on the fly. It will clarify the code and easify modifications in the future. 


###Next steps
-   Rename STUFF
-   Balance everything
-   Do the goddamn' guide on Google Docs
-   Temporary penalties on stats to force players to fight against newbs, and prevent grinding

####Optional
-   Rename/add stages
-   Add more finishers
-   Use constants everywhere.
-   On loadState, load the previous actions (seems pointless rn)
-   Implement different kind of matches: (in order of priority)
    Tables
    Ladder/Cage

#Needs testing
*   Add tap out/submit move
*   Finish features implementation
*   Add pin move
*   Add sextoy move with a temporary sextoy modifier
*   Implement a way to inflict lust (masturbate) onto your own character
*   Add !status back by saving the last message that's been sent
*   Variable end match messages, suggesting how to finish
*   Add command to load saved fight with ID
