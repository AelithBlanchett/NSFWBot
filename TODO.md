#TODO

##Important
-   Static starting stats
-   Multiply every value by 100 so we're more flexible. Need to balance that too!

###Next steps
-   Add admin commands
-   Rename STUFF
-   Balance everything
-   Do the goddamn' guide on Google Docs
-   Temporary penalties on stats to force players to fight against newbs, and prevent grinding

####Optional/Ideas
-   Add inventory/gallery to store belts/records/other?
-   Rename/add stages
-   Add more finishers
-   Use constants everywhere.
-   On loadState, load the previous actions (seems pointless rn)
-   Implement different kind of matches: (in order of priority)
    Tables
    Ladder/Cage

#Needs testing
*   Add Seasons thingy
*   Change the ActiveFighter state at the right moment
*   Use startingPower in get power() (to resume fights correctly!)
*   Correct the loadExist in ActiveFighter to implement new variables
*   Separate the Fighter entity from the 'augmented' one used in fights with hp, lp and stuff
*   Add tap out/submit move
*   Finish features implementation
*   Add pin move
*   Add sextoy move with a temporary sextoy modifier
*   Implement a way to inflict lust (masturbate) onto your own character
*   Add !status back by saving the last message that's been sent
*   Variable end match messages, suggesting how to finish
*   Add command to load saved fight with ID

#Done
