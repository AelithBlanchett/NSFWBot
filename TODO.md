#TODO

##Important
-   Rename STUFF
-   Balance everything
-   Use TYPEORM for easier database implementation
-   Refactor the fight class, use functions instead of just changing variables on the fly. It will clarify the code and easify modifications in the future. 
-   temporary Penalties on stats to force players to fight against newbs, and prevent grinding 

###Next steps
-   Do the goddamn' guide on Google Docs

####Optional
-   Rename/add stages
-   Add more finishers
-   Use constants everywhere.
-   On loadState, load the previous actions (seems pointless rn)
-   Implement different kind of matches: (in order of priority)
    Tables
    Ladder/Cage
