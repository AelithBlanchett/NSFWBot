!rest, !pass, the 'Climbing the ropes' hold (and make it needed to do the Senton bomb)


[20:41] Lustful Aelith: Should !rest and !pass be different?
[20:42] Nastasya Bates: Yes
[20:42] Lustful Aelith: What should rest give?
[20:42] Nastasya Bates: !rest is for getting rid of all your bonuses and releasing all the holds you have placed on your opponent
[20:43] Nastasya Bates: For now no HP gain or lust drop
[20:43] Nastasya Bates: We'll just have it be as bare bones as possible
[20:43] Nastasya Bates: !pass does nothing and works if you're in a hold
[20:43] Nastasya Bates: The idea is you're giving up your turn like if you want to cum or something
