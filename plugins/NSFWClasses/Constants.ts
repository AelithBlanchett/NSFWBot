    It's easy! First, you need to register.
    Just type "!register", and your profile will be created.
    You will have 1 point in every stat: Power, Sensuality, Toughness, Endurance, Dexterity, Willpower.

    Power will be used wear out the defender Physically with your strength, reducing their Health
    Sensuality will wear out the defender Sexually
    Toughness will help you resist Physical attacks by increasing your maximum Health
    Endurance will help you resist Sexual attacks, and increasing your Lust and Orgasm Counter
    Dexterity will help your moves to hit, help you to dodge attacks and influence your initiative
    Willpower will help you to keep your focus, and increase your Focus barâ€™s bounds

    Your overall Health is primarily determined by your Toughness plus a percentage of your overall stats.
    Your Lust and Orgasm Counter scales with the Endurance and also a percentage of your overall stats.

    Health works similarly to how Lust does.
    For your health, you will have 5 hearts, each representing 25 HP.
    For your lust, the hearts are replaced by the Orgasm Counter, and the HP by a Lust Counter.
    The Orgasm Counter will go up to X, this X being your Endurance.
    You will trigger an orgasm when you max your Lust Counter, which will reset back to 0, and removing one orgasm from your Orgasm Counter.
    No Hearts = No More Orgasms = You're out!
