Changes to implement:
"the system is subtracting the total cost to upgrade stats and not the upgrade cost. level 3 strength subtracted 5 then 12 for a total of 17 instead of 5 then 7 for the total of 12."
-The higher the tier, the longer the hold should last/the harder the escape should be




Stat changes:

Toughness
Endurance
Agility
Strength
Expertise
Determination
>>>> T.E.A.S.E.D.

 So, I think having the HP stat determined by the total of stats except endurance is cool
Endurance affecting the total lust pool is fine too. Determination for the resistance is good.

The starting stats will be 10 and the maximum points will be 24 cap out of a total max of 36


Brawler = Pure Strength
Submission Specialist = Strength + Agility
High Flyer = Pure Agility
Martial Artist = Agility + Expertise
Sex Fiend/Bondage Expert = Pure Expertise
Erotic Wrestler (humiliation?) = Strength + Expertise






New attack system:

I need a light, medium and heavy attack combination where light attacks do minimal acceptable damage with some sort of bonus, medium attacks do slightly greater damage at a mild risk and heavy attacks do quite a bit of damage but at great risk

Rolling: All attack rolls are Stat + 1d6, or if using two stats: (stat1+stat2/2) rounded down + 1d6 

Light 6 dice score required
Medium 8 dice score
Heavy 10 dice score

Damage: (strength + ((strength - 1)/6)) - toughness (example for a pure brawl attack)

All attacks will do fixed damage based on the type of attack used.


[20:34] Nastasya Bates: "Brawl, High Flyer & Martial Arts" are all defended by toughness
[20:34] Nastasya Bates: Sexual is defended by Endurance only
[20:35] Nastasya Bates: Submission and Humiliation are both defended by Determination









Lust attacks:

[21:35] Nastasya Bates: [21:29] Nastasya Bates: We'll do !f for "fighting" attacks, !h for "holds", !s for "sexual" attacks and !b for "bondage" attacks
[21:29] Nastasya Bates: Fighting attacks include all of brawl, all of martial arts and all of high flying attacks
[21:30] Nastasya Bates: Holds will include all submission specialist moves
[21:30] Nastasya Bates: Sexual will include only sexual attacks that damage the "Lust" bar which will include Humiliation attacks as well as physical sexual attacks
[21:31] Nastasya Bates: Bondage attacks will do the Light, Medium and Heavy bondage in 3 areas (Torso (including head), Legs and Arms)
[21:32] Nastasya Bates: So if a fighting attack is !f Light for a light attack a bondage attack will be !b Arms Light
[21:33] Nastasya Bates: Bondage attacks cannot be escaped once applied
[21:33] Nastasya Bates: But they must go in the order Light, Medium, Heavy
[21:33] Nastasya Bates: So you must place 9 successful attacks on your opponent to achieve victory
[21:36] Kallinx-F: 9 successful bondage attacks or just 9 attacks in general?
[21:36] Nastasya Bates: 9 Successful bondage attacks
[21:36] Kallinx-F: ok
[21:36] Lustful Aelith: which is quite balanced imo
[21:36] Ashtika giggles, hoping she gets to be a high-flying humiliator. If not, she'll have some tough decisions to make as to how to play Ash!
[21:37] Miss Ivy Valentine: Whats the difference between light and heavy bondage
[21:37] Nastasya Bates: As much or as little as you want
[21:37] Nastasya Bates: There are no 'moves'
[21:37] Nastasya Bates: that's just the win condition
[21:37] Miss Ivy Valentine: Ah I see
[21:37] Kallinx-F is gonna be either a martial artist or all high flying
[21:37] Nastasya Bates: All attacks are divided as "Light", "Medium" and "Heavy"
[21:38] Nastasya Bates: So you can use a punch attack as a jab (light), a straight punch (medium) or a hay maker (heavy)
[21:38] Nastasya Bates: But there are no moves called "punch", "jab", "straight punch" or "hay maker"
[21:39] Nastasya Bates: You can also use your punch as a martial arts move where it'll be based on agility and expertise or a brawl move where it will be based on strength
[21:41] Lustful Aelith: What about the lust bar itself?
[21:41] Kallinx-F: Would a little thing like embellishing potentially add the the attack?
[21:42] Nastasya Bates: Same as the HP bar.
[21:42] Nastasya Bates: Nothing in RP adds to the effectiveness of an attack
[21:42] Kallinx-F: Could we still do it for funsies to make it more action packed for the audience?
[21:43] Nastasya Bates: HP is the (starting number) + all stats except endurance
Lust is (starting number) + (Endurance x (modifer))
[21:43] Miss Ivy Valentine: of course!
[21:43] Miss Ivy Valentine: Half the fun is the emotes :)
[21:43] Nastasya Bates: Yes, I have nothing against you doing anything.
[21:43] Ashtika: Playing up for the crowd is essential! To me, anyway.
[21:43] Nastasya Bates: We are also adding !pass and !recover to the list of commands
[21:44] Nastasya Bates: !pass just passes your turn to your opponent if you want to cum or... whatever
[21:44] Kallinx-F: Oh I want to have an outfit, an entrance and maybe some pre match trash talk to hype the fight up
[21:44] Nastasya Bates: !recover resets all accrued bonuses and recovers some health and lust to both characters
[21:46] Nastasya Bates: Okay as for the Lust Bar, it's the exact same thing as the HP bar. No Lust + Stamina or anything
[21:46] Nastasya Bates: Lust bar starts at 0 and goes up to maximum. HP bar starts at maximum and drops to 0
[21:47] Nastasya Bates: The roleplayers themselves will determine when they have orgasms. I will set roleplay-only parameters about orgasms
[21:47] Nastasya Bates: So those have nothing to do with what you need to worry about Aelith
[21:48] Lustful Aelith: Okie dokie
[21:48] Nastasya Bates: For example, we can say that a normal person will cum at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of their Lust meter for 4 total orgasms
[21:49] Nastasya Bates: This will not be enforced by the bot but is up to the discretion of the players
[21:49] Nastasya Bates: If someone's character has a hair trigger they may orgasm every 10% of their Lust bar filling
[21:49] Kallinx-F: can the players set up themselves what happens during certain points in their bar on an individual basis?
[21:50] Nastasya Bates: Yes, that's what I said.
[21:50] Nastasya Bates: Players have individual control of their character's orgasms
[21:50] Kallinx-F: What I mean is not just orgasm but have other effects on themselves as well
[21:50] Nastasya Bates: The only thing the bot enforces is that at 100% of the bar being filled, the person can no longer fight
[21:51] Nastasya Bates: They can either be exhausted or too embarrassed to continue or have a deep 'need' to submit to their opponent or whatever
[21:51] Kallinx-F: Can individuals set that lower? Like they woudl succumb to the 'need at like 50 or 75% instead of the 100
[21:52] Nastasya Bates: Technically they can, there is a !submit function in the bot already that causes the person to lose
[21:52] Nastasya Bates: So they can choose to lose if they so desire
[21:53] Nastasya Bates: !help
[21:53] Benikage: Here are the available commands: !addFeature, !addStats, !addfeature, !addstats, !b, !brawl, !current, !dbg, !deleteProfile, !deleteprofile, !e, !escape, !escapeHold, !escapehold, !exit, !fight, !flood, !forfeit, !getStats, !getstats, !giveUp, !giveup, !grapple, !grappling, !h, !help, !hit, !hold, !holds, !hp, !leave, !leaveFight, !leavefight, !list, !listops, !lose, !lust, !myStats, !mystats, !ready, !register, !reloadplugins, !removeFeatures, !removeStats, !removefeatures, !removestats, !reset, !restart, !s, !sex, !sextoys, !sexual, !stamina, !stats, !status, !submission, !submit, !surrender, !t, !tapout, !test, !throw, !throws, !toys, !triggerDebug, !triggerdebug, !unready, !version, !win, !wrestle
[21:53] Kallinx-F: Okay. Mine will be lower than normal. I don't care if I make myself easier to beat.
[21:54] Miss Ivy Valentine: Hehe Your endurance is taking care of that for you already Kallinx ;)
[21:54] Ashtika giggles.
[21:54] Miss Ivy Valentine: Right now its basically how many orgasms you can have before you submit...for you that is 2
[21:55] Kallinx-F: but I am talking about the new system. Unless I am understanding that wrong
[21:55] Nastasya Bates: No, you're understanding it correctly
[21:55] Miss Ivy Valentine: Oh ok...thought you were talking about the current one
[21:56] Miss Ivy Valentine: carry on
[21:56] Kallinx-F: like 50% is when I will end up submitting in the new system
[22:01] Kallinx-F will be easy to beat probably
[22:06] Nastasya Bates: GAIZ
[22:06] Miss Ivy Valentine: SUP!
[22:06] Kallinx-F: ????
[22:06] Nastasya Bates: GAIZ
[22:06] Ashtika: o-o
[22:06] Miss Ivy Valentine: GURLZ~
[22:06] Nastasya Bates: Aelith is apparently going to make "Humiliation" holds
[22:06] Ashtika: Yessssssss
[22:06] Kallinx-F: Oh?
[22:06] Miss Ivy Valentine: Are my dreams coming true....
[22:06] Ashtika dances with Ivy in celebration!
[22:07] Nastasya Bates: So please tell everyone Aelith and I will no longer be balancing or changing Version 1
[22:07] Heather Sunderland: Hopefully that involves Smothers and facesitsss?
[22:07] Miss Ivy Valentine bounces around with the little imp
[22:07] Nastasya Bates: All inconsistencies and issues will be left alone
[22:07] Ashtika nods. Roger that.
[22:07] Kallinx-F dances?
[22:07] Nastasya Bates: Aelith is only going to work on a prototype for Version 2
[22:08] Miss Ivy Valentine: Thanks Aelith you da best!
[22:08] Ashtika: Mhmm! We'll give you all of our spirit energy!
[22:08] Ashtika: \o/
[22:08] Kallinx-F: What kind of holds would the be?
[22:09] Nastasya Bates: We're not describing anything. All 'attacks' will be at the discretion of the roleplayers involved
[22:09] Lustful Aelith: ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ GIVE MEH ENERGY ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
[22:09] Kallinx-F: Ahhh
[22:09] Ashtika energizes Aelith by sitting on her lap while she works~
[22:10] Nastasya Bates: Humiliation Holds will use sexual stats and attack "lust" but work the same way as regular submission hold attacks
[22:10] Miss Ivy Valentine joins in sitting on top of ash
[22:10] Nastasya Bates: Now an important distinction is going to be made
[22:10] Nastasya Bates: Lust based fighters can be walled by high endurance levels
[22:10] Lustful Aelith gropes Ashtika's boobs with her left hand while her right is for Ivy
[22:11] Nastasya Bates: Just like now
[22:11] Nastasya Bates: However, players heavily invested in Lust-based combat will have two win conditions. Either raising an opponent's lust to 100% OR using the bondage win condition
[22:12] Nastasya Bates: Both of those will be using the same stats
[22:12] Miss Ivy Valentine: Nice :)
[22:13] Nastasya Bates: Once the prototype is made I will work on an alternative win condition for HP-based fighters not to get walled
[22:13] Ashtika nods. That's a great idea.
[22:14] Miss Ivy Valentine ties the little imp up with her whip "I think I got the hang of it..."
[22:14] Nastasya Bates: For now though that's all. HP reaches 0, Lust reaches 100% OR a fully bound opponent are the three win conditions
