New attack system:

I need a light, medium and heavy attack combination where light attacks do minimal acceptable damage with some sort of bonus, medium attacks do slightly greater damage at a mild risk and heavy attacks do quite a bit of damage but at great risk
1d(stat) + 1d10, or if using two stats: 1d(stat1+stat2/2) + 1d10 rounded down (floor)
if I have 1 strength my roll is 1d1 + 1d10. If I have 6 strength my roll is 1d6+1d10

All attacks will do fixed damage based on the type of attack used. Brawl Light attacks will be 7 - toughness for example but a medium attack will be 10 - toughness and heavy attacks 12 - toughness
