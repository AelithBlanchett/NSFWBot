New attack system:

I need a light, medium and heavy attack combination where light attacks do minimal acceptable damage with some sort of bonus, medium attacks do slightly greater damage at a mild risk and heavy attacks do quite a bit of damage but at great risk

Light 4
Medium 6
Heavy 8

damage: (strength + ((strength - 1)/6)) - toughness

stat + 1d6, or if using two stats: (stat1+stat2/2) rounded down + 1d6 

All attacks will do fixed damage based on the type of attack used. Brawl Light attacks will be 7 - toughness for example but a medium attack will be 10 - toughness and heavy attacks 12 - toughness
